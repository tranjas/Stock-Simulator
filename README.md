# Stock Simulator Backend - README
Welcome to the Stock Simulator Backend! This Spring Boot application provides APIs to manage users, portfolios, stocks, and transactions. It forms the backbone of a stock simulation platform, allowing operations such as user management, stock trading, and portfolio updates.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
The backend is structured using a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns:

Controllers: Expose REST APIs for interaction.

Services: Handle business logic and processing.

Repositories: Interface with the database for CRUD operations.

DTOs: Data Transfer Objects for managing structured data flow between layers.
